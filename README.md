# TVGM-NorthChina
This archive contains the degree 120 time-variable gravity field models over North China (110-130E, 20-50N), determined using the Slepian method and terrestrial-only gravity measurements from multiple campaigns from 2011 to 2013. The file NorthChina_study_area_boundary_lonlat.txt contains the coordinates of the points that define the boundary of the study area.

Taking the model file diff_2013_04-2012_03.txt as an example, it means the gravity differences between the two campaigns in April 2013 and March 2012. The gravity differences are in microgal (10^{-8} m/s^2), and the grid interval is 0.1 degree.

A paper documenting the determination of these models is in press.
