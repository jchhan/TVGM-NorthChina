# TVGM-NorthChina
This archive contains the degree 120 time-variable gravity field models over North China (110-130E, 20-50N), which are determined using the Slepian method and terrestrial gravity observations from 2011 to 2013. 

Taking the model file diff_2013_04-2012_03.txt as an example, it means the gravity differences between the two campaigns in April 2013 and March 2012. The gravity differences are in microgal and the grid interval is 0.1 degree.
